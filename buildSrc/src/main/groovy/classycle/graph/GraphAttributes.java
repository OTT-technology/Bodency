 * Attributes of a graph. The following properties
 * can be accessed with this interface:
 * <dl><dt>Girth:</dt><dd>The length of the shortest cycle.</dd>
 * <dt>Eccentricities:</dt>
 * <dd>The eccentricity for each vertex of the graph. The eccentricity of
 * a vertex is the largest <em>distance</em> to other vertices of the
 * graph. The distance between vertex A and B is defined as the
 * shortest path from A to B. The distance is infinite if there is
 * no path from A to B.
 * <dt>Diameter:</dt><dd>The largest eccentricity.</dd>
 * <dt>Radius:</dt><dd>The smallest eccentricity.</dd>
 * <dt>Center:</dt>
 * <dd>The set of vertices of the graph with the smallest eccentricities.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Maximum fragment sizes:</dt>
 * <dd>The maximum fragment sizes for each vertex of the graph. The
 * maximum fragment size of a vertex is defined as the size of the
 * largest strong component of the graph after the vertex has been
 * removed.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Best fragment size:</dt>
 * <dd>The smallest maximum fragment size.</dd>
 * <dt>Best fragmenters:</dt>
 * <dd>The set of vertices of the graph with smallest maximum fragment size.
